a. What line of code waits one and a half seconds?
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  
  delay(1500);                      
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    
  delay(1500);                      

b. Why does a resistor need an LED?
  Without LED as an output component, all the current will continuously go through resistor. It might be harmful to the resister. If there is no resistor with a LED, there might be too much current going through the LED. It might broke the LED. So, they protect each other.

c. Why is a breadboard useful?
It helps to connect different parts of components very easily. It also helps to organize the wires and the components once there are a lot going on at the same time.
